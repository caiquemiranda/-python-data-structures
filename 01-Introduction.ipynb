    "- Stack: It is a data structure, which follows only to specific order of operation. LIFO (last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out).\n",
    "- Queue: It is similar to Stack, but the order of operation is only FIFO (First In First Out).\n",
    "- Matrix: It is two dimensional data structure in which, the data element is referred by a pair of indices."
